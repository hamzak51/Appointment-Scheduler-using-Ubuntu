This project aims to gain practical experience with the Linux command line 
and shell scripting using Bash. The project was implemented entirely in 
Ubuntu installed via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), allowing for native 
Linux operations without needing a virtual machine. 

The project was divided into three main tasks, each focusing on a 
real-world use case involving scripting, file management, and system 
automation. 

Task 1 – File & Folder Automation Script: 

In this task, a Bash script named auto_setup.sh was developed to 
automatically create a project directory structure.  

Task 2 – Appointment Scheduling Management System: 

This task involved building a fully interactive, menu-based CLI 
management system using Bash scripting. The script, management.sh, 
functions as a scheduling tool that lets users Add, Update, View and Delete 
records. 
All data is stored in a structured text file (appointments.txt) with unique 
appointment IDs, simulating a lightweight database. 

Task 3 – RSA Key Management Tool: 

The final task focused on RSA key-based SSH authentication, a critical 
aspect of secure communication.  
The script includes error handling for missing files and unsuccessful SSH 
connections, making it a robust utility for managing secure connections in 
a Linux environment.
